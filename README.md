# ðŸ“Š Overview


# dismint's dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfiles and other configuration files I use in various parts of my EndeavourOS + Hyprland setup. Primarily for personal use but let me know if you happen to find something useful in here for yourself!

> [!WARNING]
The next part is mostly stupid things for myself so pay no note :D

## fish 

To complete the setup, installer [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher), which can then be used to install [tide](https://github.com/IlanCosman/tide). My tide setup is as follows:

- (1) Lean
- (2) 16 colors
- (2) 24-hour format
- (2) Two lines
- (2) Dotted
- (2) Sparse
- (2) Many icons
- (2) Yes (to transient prompt)

## waybar

In order for the waybar to work properly, the system needs to have **AwesomeFont** installed. I trust that I can ~~pirate~~ attain this legally in the future as well.

## nvim

Yeah this one is a mess and needs some work...
